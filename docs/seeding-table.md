## Explanation

- **Number of Seeded Players**: The total number of players receiving preferential placement based on their ranking/seeding score
- **Part of Draw**: The section of the bracket (quarter or round of 16 match) being filled
- **First Place**: Seed range placed at the top position of that section
- **Last Place**: Seed range placed at the bottom position of that section

### Seeding Ranges:
- **1**: Top seed (strongest player)
- **2**: Second seed
- **3-4**: Seeds 3 and 4
- **5-8**: Seeds 5 through 8
- **9-16**: Seeds 9 through 16

### Example (16 seeds):
- 1st round of 16 match: Seed #1 (top) vs. Seed #9-16 (bottom)
- 2nd round of 16 match: Seed #9-16 (top) vs. Seed #5-8 (bottom)
- And so on...

This ensures that the strongest seeds are distributed across the bracket to avoid early matchups between top players, following standard tournament seeding principles.
