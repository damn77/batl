## Bugs ##
Create tournament modal
- missing optional address field
- Category selections
    - items should be ordered alphabetically

Player registration /player/register
- player should only be able to register themselves
- Select player form should be hidden when user is player and visible for organizer and admin

Tournaments page /organizer/tournaments
- I can see newly created tournament in the list but am not able to access it's page to modify it or update player registrations


## Missed requirements ##
Create tournament modal
- add toggle "Single day tournament"
    - if ON the End Date field and label should be hidden and their value should auto match start date
    - by default the toggle is ON
