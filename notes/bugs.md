## Bugs ##
Create tournament modal
- missing optional address field

Tournaments page /organizer/tournaments
- I can see newly created tournament in the list but am not able to access it's page to modify it or update player registrations


## Missed requirements ##


## Future improvements ##
- When creating/editing a tournament, location can be selected from list of existing locations or new location can be added on the fly (button to open location modal)
- When viewing tournament details with location address defined show a map with the location
- When creating/editing a tournament, capacity can be defined
    - connect to Google Maps API to get the capacity of the location
