## Tournaments rules ##
- tournaments can be played in different formats
    - knockout
    - groups
    - swiss system
    - combined (groups + knockout)
- in knockout tournaments players have guaranteed number of matches
    - 1 match guarantee is classic knockout format
    - 2 match guarantee mean ever player who lost their 1st match continues in separate knockout bracket
    - until position - means player continues until his exact placement among players is clear (e.g. 16 participants means 4 matches played by everyone)
- tournament rules can be defined per: 
    - tournament (mandatory)
    - round (knockout, swiss system)
    - group (e.g. tables with less players can have different scoring rules)
    - individual match
- rules cascade down: Tournament -> group/bracket -> round -> match
- tournament rules can be adjusted at any time even in the middle of the tournament
