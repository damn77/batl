## Tournaments rules ##
- tournaments can be played in different formats
    - knockout
    - group (only single group, in case of multiple groups combined format is used)
    - swiss system
    - combined (groups + knockout)
- in knockout tournaments players have guaranteed number of matches
    - 1 match guarantee is classic knockout format
    - 2 match guarantee means ever player who has lost their 1st match continues in separate knockout bracket
    - until position - means player continues until his exact placement among players is clear (e.g. 16 participants means 4 matches played by everyone)
- in tournaments with groups, size of group is selected
    - groups are created with set group size or 1 less depending on available players
        - e.g. group size 4, with 10 players means 1x group of 4, 2x group of 3
        - if it isn't possible to split Y players into groups of X and X-1 show error message
- in combined tournaments
    - number of players that continue to knockout per group is selected
    - multiple knockout brackets can be set
        - e.g. 1st and 2nd player continue to main knockout, 3rd continue in different knockout bracket, 4th doesn't continue
- tournament rules can be defined per: 
    - tournament (mandatory)
    - round (knockout, swiss system)
    - group (e.g. tables with less players can have different scoring rules)
    - individual match
- rules cascade down: Tournament -> group/bracket -> round -> match
- tournament rules can be adjusted at any time even in the middle of the tournament
- match score rules are defined by
    - format
        - sets
            - "2 sets" match is played for 2 winning sets e.g. 6:4, 4:6, 6:1 
            - options are 1/2 winning sets
            - standard set is decided by standard tiebreak at 6:6
        - tiebreaks (standard)
            - standard tiebreak is played until player has 7 points and difference of at least 2 point
            - options are 1/2/3 winning standard tiebreaks
        - tiebreaks (big)
            - standard tiebreak is played until player has 10 points and difference of at least 2 point
            - options are 1/2 winning big tiebreaks

    - advantage rule
        - are games played with advantage or with golden ball
        - options ADV/NO-ADV

            - groups with more players in group/combined tournaments
            - remaining matches in round in "until placement" tournaments once 1 match of that round is finished
        - organizer can change rules for specific match
