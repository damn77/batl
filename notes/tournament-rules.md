## Tournaments rules ##
- tournaments can be played in different formats
    - knockout
    - groups
    - swiss system
    - combined (groups + knockout)
- in knockout tournaments players have guaranteed number of matches
    - 1 match guarantee is classic knockout format
    - 2 match guarantee means ever player who has lost their 1st match continues in separate knockout bracket
    - until position - means player continues until his exact placement among players is clear (e.g. 16 participants means 4 matches played by everyone)
- in group tournament size of group is selected
    - groups are created with set group size or 1 less depending on available players
        - e.g. group size 4, with 10 players means 1x group of 4, 2x group of 3
        - if it isn't possible to split Y players into groups of X and X-1 show error message
- tournament rules can be defined per: 
    - tournament (mandatory)
    - round (knockout, swiss system)
    - group (e.g. tables with less players can have different scoring rules)
